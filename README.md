# fourfuckingbuttons
Stupid four-button calculator concept.

This is a brand-new codebase, so there largely won't be anything until I start pushing commits. 

I have selected the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W for this. It's probably overkill, but the board is easy to obtain and program. 

Which language used is still up for decision. I am deciding between C++ and Python. 

Please see CONTROLPLAN.md for plans around user interaction.
